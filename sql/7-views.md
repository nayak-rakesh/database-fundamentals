### View
* Views are database objects created from the results of stored queries. Let's say we have a complex query which we use often in out application.
It might be tedious to write the same complex query multiple time in different places.
* In such case we can store the complex query as a view and access it afterwards when needed with a simple sql statement.
* It's important to remember that tables those are generated by views are not actual tables. These are virtual tables.
* Let's say we want to access all the orders and customers related to those orders frequently in our application.
```sql
SELECT
	customers.name, customers.address, orders.item, orders.quantity
FROM 
	customers, orders
WHERE
	customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```
**output**
```
   name   | address |  item  | quantity 
----------+---------+--------+----------
 Jack     | London  | Book   |        2
 Jack     | London  | Watch  |        1
 Tom      | Austin  | Bag    |        1
 Samantha | Boston  | Jeans  |        3
 Nick     | Miami   | Bottle |        5
```
* So we can create a view and use it whenever is required in our application. Following statement would create a view named `order_details`.
```sql
CREATE VIEW order_details AS 
SELECT
	customers.name, customers.address, orders.item, orders.quantity
FROM 
	customers, orders
WHERE
	customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```
* Now we can easily access the view with a simple statement as follow and we would get the exact result.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM 
	order_details; -- name of the view
```
**output**
```
   name   | address |  item  | quantity 
----------+---------+--------+----------
 Jack     | London  | Book   |        2
 Jack     | London  | Watch  |        1
 Tom      | Austin  | Bag    |        1
 Samantha | Boston  | Jeans  |        3
 Nick     | Miami   | Bottle |        5
```
* We can alter the existing views.
```sql
ALTER VIEW 
	order_details
RENAME TO
	order_info; -- renaming the view
```
* We can delete a view.
```sql
DROP VIEW order_info;
```
